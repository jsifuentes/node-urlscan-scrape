# URLscan.io scrape

This was a quick little script I made after I read an article about urlscan.io and how irresponsible users tend to upload sensitive documents to the service which can be downloaded by any other user.

This was the beginning of a script to see if I could somehow detect "sensitive"-ish documents automatically, but instead, all it does is dump out the latest file uploads every 10 seconds.
